      <h3>Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)</h3>
      <p> Coronary artery disease, also known as coronary heart disease, is the most common type of 
          heart disease.It develops when the arteries that supply blood to the heart become clogged 
          with plaque. This causes them to harden and narrow. Plaque contains cholesterol and other 
          substances.As a result, the blood supply reduces, and the heart receives less oxygen and 
          fewer nutrients. In time, the heart muscle weakens, and there is a risk of heart failure 
          and arrhythmias.When plaque builds up in the arteries, it is called atherosclerosis. 
          Plaque in the arteries can rupture from blockages and cause blood flow to stop, which 
          can lead to a heart attack. 
      </p>

    <div class="col-sm">
      <h3>Heart Arrhythmias</h3>
      <p>Arrhythmia refers to an irregular heartbeat. It occurs when the electrical impulses 
        that coordinate the heartbeat do not work correctly. As a result, the heart may beat 
        too quickly, too slowly, or erratically.
        <br>
        There are various types of arrhythmias, including:
        <ul>
          <li> <strong>Tachycardia: </strong>This refers to a rapid heartbeat.</li>
          <li> <strong>Bradycardia: </strong>This refers to a slow heartbeat.</li>
          <li> <strong>Premature contractions: </strong>This refers to an early heartbeat.</li>
          <li> <strong>Atrial fibrillation: </strong>This is a type of irregular heartbeat.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm">
      <h3>Heart Failure</h3>
      <p>When a person has heart failure, their heart is still working but not as well as it should be. 
        Congestive heart failure is a type of heart failure that can occur from problems with the pumping 
        or relaxing function.
        <br>
        Heart failure can result from untreated coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, arrhythmias,
        and other conditions. These conditions can affect the heart’s ability to pump or relax properly.
        <br>
        Heart failure can be life threatening, but seeking early treatment for heart-related conditions 
        can help prevent complications.</p>

    <div class="col-sm">
      <h3>Heart Valve Disease</h3>
      <p>Your heart has four valves that open and close to direct blood flow between your heart's 
        four chambers, the lungs, and blood vessels. An abnormality could make it hard for a valve 
        to open and close the right way. When that happens, your blood flow could be blocked or blood 
        can leak. Your valve may not open and close right
        <br>
        The causes of heart valve problems include infections such as rheumatic fever, congenital heart 
        disease, high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, or as a result of a heart attack.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm">
      <h3>Pericardial Disease</h3>
      <p>Any disease of the pericardium, the sac that surrounds your heart, is called a pericardial 
        disease. One of the more common diseases is pericarditis or inflammation of the pericardium.
        <br>
        It's usually caused by an infection with a virus, inflammatory diseases such as lupus or 
        rheumatoid arthritis, or injury to your pericardium. Pericarditis often follows open 
        heart surgery.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm">
      <h3>Cardiomyopathy(Heart Muscle Disease)</h3>
      <p>Cardiomyopathy is a disease of your heart muscle, or myocardium. It gets stretched, thickened, 
        or stiff. Your heart may get too weak to pump well.
        <br>
        There are many possible causes of the disease, including genetic heart conditions, reactions to 
        certain drugs or toxins (such as alcohol), and infections from a virus. Sometimes, chemotherapy 
        causes cardiomyopathy. Many times, doctors can't find the exact cause.</p>

    <div class="col-sm">
      <h3>Congenital Heart Disease</h3>
      <p>A person with a congenital heart defect is born with a heart problem. There are many types 
        of congenital heart defects, including:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Heart attack: </strong>Chest pain or discomfort, upper back or neck pain, 
            indigestion, heartburn, nausea or vomiting,extreme fatigue, upper body discomfort, 
            dizziness, and shortness of breath.</li>
          <li><strong>Arrhythmia: </strong>Fluttering feelings in the chest (palpitations).</li>
          <li><strong>Heart failure: </strong>Shortness of breath, fatigue, or swelling of the feet, 
              ankles, legs, abdomen, or neck veins.</li>
        </ul>
        Congenital heart disease can involve major structural issues, such as the absence of a ventricle
         or problems with unusual connections between the main arteries that leave the heart.Many 
         congenital heart defects do not cause any noticeable symptoms and only become apparent during 
         a routine medical check. According to the American Heart Association (AHA), heart murmurs 
         often affect children, but only some are due to a defect.</p>
